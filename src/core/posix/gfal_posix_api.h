/**
 * @brief open a file
 *
 *  Similar behavior to the POSIX open  ( man 2 open )
 *  gfal_open supports the same flags than the POSIX open call
 *
 *  O_TRUNC
 *		  If  the file already exists and is a regular file and the open mode allows writing (i.e., is O_RDWR or O_WRONLY) it will be truncated to length 0.  If the file is a FIFO or termi‚Äê
 *		  nal device file, the O_TRUNC flag is ignored.  Otherwise the effect of O_TRUNC is unspecified.
 *
 *  O_APPEND
 *		  The  file  is opened in append mode.  Before each write(2), the file offset is positioned at the end of the file, as if with lseek(2).  O_APPEND may lead to corrupted files on NFS
 *		  file systems if more than one process appends data to a file at once.  This is because NFS does not support appending to a file, so the client kernel has  to  simulate  it,  which
 *		  can't be done without a race condition.
 *
 *   O_CREAT
 *            If the file does not exist it will be created.  The owner (user ID) of the file is set to the effective user ID of the process.  The group ownership (group ID) is  set  either  to
 *            the  effective  group  ID of the process or to the group ID of the parent directory (depending on file system type and mount options, and the mode of the parent directory, see the
 *             mount options bsdgroups and sysvgroups described in mount(8)).
 *
 *             mode specifies the permissions to use in case a new file is created.  This argument must be supplied when O_CREAT is specified in flags; if O_CREAT is not specified, then mode  is
 *             ignored.   The  effective  permissions  are  modified  by  the process's umask in the usual way: The permissions of the created file are (mode & ~umask).  Note that this mode only
 *             applies to future accesses of the newly created file; the open() call that creates a read-only file may well return a read/write file descriptor.
 *
 *
 *
 *       O_DIRECT
 *             Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O to and from this file.  In general this will degrade performance, but it is useful in special situations, such  as  when  applications  do
 *             their  own  caching.   File I/O is done directly to/from user space buffers.  The O_DIRECT flag on its own makes at an effort to transfer data synchronously, but does not give the
 *             guarantees of the O_SYNC that data and necessary metadata are transferred.  To guarantee synchronous I/O the O_SYNC must be used in addition to O_DIRECT.  See NOTES below for fur‚Äê
 *             ther discussion.
 *
 *      O_LARGEFILE
 *             (LFS) Allow files whose sizes cannot be represented in an off_t (but can be represented in an off64_t) to be opened.  The _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE macro must be defined (before includ‚Äê
 *             ing  any  header  files)  in  order  to  obtain this definition.  Setting the _FILE_OFFSET_BITS feature test macro to 64 (rather than using O_LARGEFILE) is the preferred method of
 *             obtaining method of accessing large files on 32-bit systems
 *
 *
 * @param url : url of the file to open
 * @param flags : flags to use ( similar to open )
 * @param mode (optional) : mode of the file in case of a new file.
 * @return This routine return a valid file descriptor if the operation is a success
